Totally we have 1,127,090 clusters (representative fragments) in the 8000 residue groups
and the distribution histogram of the numbers of clusters in all residue groups is shown in Fig. 6.

The operating system is Microsoft Windows XP Professional Version 2002 Service Pack 2.
As Table 2 shows, our method is comparable to the previous works, especially SABBAC, in the first testing set.
Based on the rule, we can obtain the ending-period capital $2.0768 from 1999/1/1 to 2008/12/31.

With these best parameters, we try to find out the best constant weights, which can be used throughout the whole investment.
In Table 3, we summarize the performance of various strategies.
In this paper, we study how to compute the CLCS of the strings which are in RLE format.
Among the 30 proteins in Table 3 that contain only standard residues, we have better solutions in 12 proteins and equal solutions in 2 proteins.
